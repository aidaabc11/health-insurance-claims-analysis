# Health Insurance Claim Prediction

## 🧾 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting health insurance claims using demographic, medical, and geographic features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Claim Amount
- State and City
- Diagnosis Type (Inpatient/Outpatient)
- Disease details
- Hospital or treatment center
- Date of claim
- Other medical features...

The goal is to build a robust pipeline that can predict expected claim amounts and detect potential anomalies, using both classical ML and LLM-based approaches.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Hugging Face Transformers (LLM/NLP Tools)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git / GitHub

## 🚀 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess healthcare claim data
- Explore relationships between demographic and medical variables
- Build predictive models for claim amount and risk classification
- Optionally apply LLMs for entity extraction and intelligent tagging
- Create visualizations and model evaluation metrics

## 📊 Data

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:
**[Claim Prediction Dataset – Link Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**  
(*Update this with the actual dataset you choose*)

## 💡 Future Work

- Use LLMs for tagging disease categories
- Integrate Explainable AI (XAI)
- Build a dashboard for insights
